          Search Engine Optimization, more commonly referred to as SEO, is one of the most crucila aspects of marketing. While a successful SEO strategy isn't an exact science, and its practice has been challenged
          on many fronts throughout the years, knowing the basics is still important to an effective marketing compaign.
          <br>
          SEO refers to the process of making a website more visible on a search engine's results page. To clarify, a great SEO strategy will put a company website at the top of the list on a Google search page, therefore increasing the likelihood
          that people will visit the site. Search Engine strive to provide the most relevant results for a person conducting a search, so that when a person runs a internet search for "cupcakes", the first things to appear isn't a cookie shop, but a bakery that specializes in cupcakes as well as a definition of dessert.
          <br>
          Search engines work by searching the Internet to find text that meets certain criteria. This text is known as keywords and refers to the most important theme(s) of the website, company, or product. Scouring the online world to find keywords are why, as in the example above, a search for “cupcakes” yields a 
          result of multiple pages about cupcakes, not cookies. Other important things that a search engine uses to rank a website include titles, headings, and links that make up the content of a website’s pages. Search engines also employ search engine indexing to find, digest, and store the content of a website. A search engine index refers to the set of data that’s used to base a final search result on.
          <br>
          Another important part of an SEO introduction is understanding the significance of keywords. We explained above that keywords are the specific words or set of words that best describe the theme or overall concept of an idea, website, business, or product. Keywords are the words that people use when conducting a search, and should be words that are included in the content of your webpage. Choosing the
          right keywords can help to drive traffic to your site, attract potential customers, and greatly improve your SEO ranking.
